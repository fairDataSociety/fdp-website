  headline: "<strong>FairOS</strong>"
  content: <strong>FairOS</strong><br>FairOS is aiming to become a decentralized operating
    system that manages the resources of the computers in its network, like storage
    and compute. The nodes that run FairOS will be part of the global network that
    will run applications which can make use of the storage and compute that is available.
    It consists of two layers, namely FairOS-dfs (storage) and FairOS-compute (compute).
    You can access the the documentation <a href="https://docs.fairos.fairdatasociety.org/docs/"
    title="">here</a>.<br><br><strong>FairOS in WASM</strong><br>FairOS-dfs library
    is supported in WASM. You can access the GitHub <a href="Fairdrive is a dApp that
    enables decentralized storage on Swarm. It consists of a typical &quot;Drive&quot;
    interface with files and folders, and a BZZ wallet to manage token balances and
    keypairs. " title="">here</a>.
